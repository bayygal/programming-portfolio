        <h3>How did you grow over the past 3 years?</h3>
    </div>

        <div class="word-content" style="margin-right: -30%; margin-left: -10%;">
            <p>Over the past 3 years, I've grown in many more ways than I expected. Academically, I've grown to become a better learner,
                but I've also learned to not beat myself down so hard  because of my academics. I've grown to appreciate the time
                that I have in high school and to take it easy. I will say, as a result of learning to relax more, my work ethic
                has grown to be tremendously intense in all other aspects of my life.

        <h3>What does it mean for you to “do math”? “do science”? “do engineering”?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="word-content">
        <p>For me, "doing" math, science, and engineering is being able to understand the concepts, being able to apply them in context (in the projects),
            and to be able to draw connections from different topics. The most important part of "doing," is the application of the concepts.
            Application shows true mastery by incorporating demonstration of the concepts into real-world situations which makes it a skill that
            can be used in the context of a job. Moreover, through application, a person can gain a deeper understanding of a concept.</p>

        <h3>How are you different as a person, and as a learner, from when you entered the STEM program?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="word-content">
        <p>As a person, I've grown to be more understanding over other people and have gained confidence in my abilities, communication,
            and overall work. Coming into the STEM program, I was nervous that my skills and abilities wouldn't be enough for the STEM program.
            However, through the countless projects, I've built built upon my skills and realized that even if my abilities aren't enough,
            I can always learn and grow from other people do have the skill. A part of that is learning to understand other people. To be able
            to learn from other people, I had to learn to understand how different people process different concepts. I have become more open-minded
            as a result.

        <h3>How have your perceptions about math, science and engineering changed from freshman year?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">

        <div class="word-content" style="margin-right: -70%;">
            <p>Since freshman year, my perception about math has fluctuated extremely. In freshman year, learning math was a chore and learning was
                somewhat stressful. If I didn't understand a topic right away, I'd start to build anxiety which, naturally, I correlated with math
                which gave it a bad connotation. Year 2 was no different. In fact, it was hard, but I was determined to stick it through and it paid
                off. Year 3, math is fun and enjoyable. If I don't understand a concept, I'm not stressed. Math has become one of my favorite classes.
                Additionally, I think it's a result of me realizing that the world keeps moving. <br><br>
    
                With science, I freshman year and sophomore year, I was indifferent about science. I learned the content that I had to and just had
                the class for the grade. Even still, I'm indifferent to biology and chemistry somewhat, but physics is fun. With physics it's more
                understanding the concepts and less memorization. Since freshman year, I've learned that science can be fun, I just have to find
                the right one for me.
    
                My perceptions on engineering have been the same. If anything, I'm more excited about engineering. From STEM, to out of school mentors
                and experieces, my understanding of engineering has deepened and shown me that it's not all fun and games. It's shown me to think on
                a different level, to consider every perspective, and taught me that professionalism and the way you carry yourself is everything. <br><br>
    
                Overall, the difference from my freshman year to now is my outlook on life and I it's a result of my maturity over my 3 years in STEM.

        <h3>What will you take away from the program? What surprised you? What challenged you?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="word-content" style="margin-right: -50%; margin-left: -10%;">
            <p>Something I'll take away from the program is the communication and people skills that I've acquired over the past 3 years. After
                with people I wanted to and didn't want to, I've learned that the best people to work with are people you get along with and have
                similar goals to you. Working with friends isn't ideal in a lot of cases. Due to the chaos and lack of organization, communication
                skills became highly valuable in a group member. I'm realizing that in industry, communication skills are one of the best skills
                I could have, and I thank STEM very much for helping me develop that.
    
                Something that surprised me is the variation in motivation and academic goals across STEM. Coming into the program, I thought I
                would be placed with people almost exactly like me. Having the variance in goals, with people wanting to go into dentistry to
                people wanting to go into law, it was actually best for the program. Having the variance was one of the best parts of STEM because
                every project, you'd have someone with fresh perspectives, skills, and ideas to contribute. <br><br>
    
                Something that challenged me was staying motivated to do projects and work that I didn't want to do. Throughout the 3 years,
                there were many projects that were not in my interest. In non-STEM classes, I was easy to get the work over with and move on, but
                in GSCP, the project was somewhat long-term which made it kind of depressing and torturous. But I'm happy I got over it and tried
                to make the best of the projects and did my best to contribute to my group's work. Looking back, there's a lot of work that I
                could have easily done but chose not to. Going forward, I'll know how to overcome this sloth and laziness and how to make the best
                of my classes.

        <h3>What aspects of the program will you carry forward to your senior year and beyond?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="word-content">
        <p>There's 2 aspects of the program that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Those aspects are the collaboration skills and
            the abstract way of thinking. After 3 years in STEM, I've learned to be able to work with anyone and I'm thankful to have that skill.
            Carrying it forward, I'll be able to effectively collaborate both in future academic endeavors and in the context of a job. <br><br>

            STEM has fostered an abstract way of thinking and I'm able to view a concept from multiple points of view. It helps me understand
            concepts better and helps me to be able to apply them at a higher level. Carrying it forward, it'll help me understand higher-level
            concepts in college and help me solve abstract and real-world problems in my job.

        <h3>How would your experience in high school have been different if you weren’t a part of this community?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="word-content">
        <p>My experience in high school would have been far different if I wasn't part of the STEM community. I would have had a harder time
            finding a good friend group and understanding the content. The STEM community has grown to be tight knit and as a result, leaving
            STEM is a little bit hard to think about. Being part of the STEM community has only made my life better because I've been able to
            make connections and foster close relationships that would've been difficult otherwise.

        <div class="word-content" style="margin-right: -60%;">
            <p>STEM is not fun and games. Do not mess around with your GPA and for the next 2 years you have to be on point with everything you
                do in this program (trust me I know it's not what you wanted or expected). Year 1 is limbo. It's an acclimation year and its a year for you to anchor down your GPA before your next 3
                years of HS. Sophomore year mentally is hell, but academically you'll be fine, and junior year is heaven (somewhat). What I
                just said sounds kind of serious and intimidating, but take care of your work so you can take care of yourself. Along the way,
                see what interests you and what you might want to study or work as after high school. If you find it hard to do that, take what
                you like to do, such as playing games, drawing, etc., and try to fit that into your future. Also, don't let that damn phone be
                a hindrance to your learning. If you're on it for more than 4 hours, you gotta fix something. I know from personal experience
                because I reached upwards of 10 hours a day on average. Please, don't let your socials, brainrot, and skibidi toilet ruin your life.</p>
