            <p>I'll be taking IB Math Analysis HL and AP Stats to prepare myself for my future college courseload. Multivariable calculus,
            linear algebra, and lots of data science will be in my future so its necessary to take them. Additionally, I'm taking IB CS and Oracle

            On the extracurricular side, I'm planning to be vice-president of Photography Club, a student leader of the Technology Student Association

            In addition, I'm planning to be a aerospace, cyber, and leadership support officer.</p>

            <p>As you can see, I'll be applying to many competitive and rigorous schools. Ideally, I would like to attend MIT
            for computer science and engineering (this is one major). For most of the schools listed, I plan on majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in psychology or data science.
            For UPenn, I'll be applying to the Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology to obtain
            a business degree from the Wharton School and a computer engineering degree. After undergraduate, I
            plan on obtaining a master's degree from MIT.

            <p>However, to get to these big 4 companies, I have to have the proper experience, skills, and know-how. That's why I
            want to take advantage of being in high school and find an a high school internship at one of these 4 companies. After
            having applied to NASA and Lockheed Martin, I got downright rejected, which just means 1: the applicant pool is competitive
            and 2: I'm just not prepared for it yet. I hope to obtain the Lockheed Martin High School Internship this upcoming application
            cycle so that I'm already 1 foot in the door for getting a co-op or internship in college. <br><br>

            In high school and college, my approach to getting a job/internship/co-op will be roughly the same. My current objective is to
            build my skills (e.g. programming, cloud computing, statistical analysis, data visualization) to be best prepared for
            opportunities as they appear.

            <p>After undergrad, I'd like to be ready for some of the 4 companies that I mentioned earlier. I'd like to start my career at NASA
            or SpaceX, move to Boeing or Lockheed Martin, and end my career at NASA or SpaceX again. Early in my career, I have more room to take risks in
            terms of jobs and I also have the time to build my experience. I don't expect to be working at my first job for more than 1-2 years.
            NASA, being a government agency, has a lot of paper pushing which I don't want to be doing my whole life. SpaceX (Elon Musk) is
            notorious for laying off mass amounts of people at once, but I don't expect much job security at my first position. </p>

                division developing future fighters, things that go fast, and everything that I wanted to do as a kid. It's also around this time
                that that I would found a space company centered around space travel. I predict that by the time I have the skills and expertise necessary to start a
                company, the space travel industry will be massive.</p>
