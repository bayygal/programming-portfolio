                <p>Hi, I'm Randy! <br> <br>

                    I'm a programmer and computer engineer based in Alexandria, Virginia. My programming journey starts in 7th grade. I started programming
                    lightly in Python and my VEX IQ robotics team (2020), but it wasn't until sophomore year where I started notice that I liked it.
                    By this point, I had done a few small Arduino projects including a little car and, in sophomore year, a turbidimeter. It was also here
                    when I started taking up visual arts such as photography and videography. Naturally, I started to learn web development and created a
                    couple websites. <br><br>
                    
                    During this year, AI caught my interest, so I read up on some topics to eventually create my own project. In the following year, I had
                    the opportunity to enroll in Virginia Aerospace Science and Technology Scholars. After learning heavily about NASA's operations,
                    I wanted to see if AI was being integrated into spacecraft. I am eager to build my fundamentals and specialized knowledge to march
                    toward my overarching goal. I want to implement complex AI/ML concepts into spacecraft to make space travel and exploration affordable
                    and practical for the public. In doing so, I hope to share the synergy and togetherness of the space community to inspire the common
                    person, create global fellowship, and drive a truly global effort toward space exploration.
