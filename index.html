                <p>Hi, I'm Randy! <br> <br>

                    I'm a hobbyist of all things and I love to travel.
                    I was born in Arlington, Virginia and currently live in Alexandria, Virginia
                    where I attend Thomas A. Edison High School. Growing up, I loved
                    learning about space and science which was an important part of
                    my upbringing. Space is and will always be one of my greatest passions/interests 
                    and will (hopefully) be a large part of my career. <br><br>

                    Another large part of my upbringing was gaming. After watching YouTubers play Minecraft on their vibrant top-of-the-line
                    computers my entire childhood, I started researching the hardware. I eventually
                    built my own, and I've helped friends build their own. Tinkering with desktop
                    computers eventually evolved into working with Arduinos and experimenting with
                    junk motherboards and car electronics.  Additionally, I am a hands-on person and
                    enjoy being involved in every part of the process, especially the building. In
                    short, computer hardware has become soldered into my daily life.

            <p>I can play 3 instruments. In order of when I learned them,
            I can play the violin, piano, and guitar. Some of my current hobbies include
            playing sports, lifting weights, and learning about computer engineering topics.
            I hold currently hold title of #1 Iron Eagle at Edison which means, pound for pound,
            I'm the strongest in the school. If you're curious, I squat 315, bench 165, and deadlift 340.
            As for computer engineering topics, I am always learning more about AI and machine learning.
            I'm learning everything I can, whether it be statistical analysis, cloud computing, or data science,
            to prepare myself to be the best I can for when the special opportunity arises. <br><br>

            I'm also a photographer and videographer! I shoot street, nature, sports, and cultural events. Some of my photos can be found below.</p>
